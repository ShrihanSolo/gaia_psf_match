## Gaia PSF Matching Algorithm  

With minimal effort, a pipeline to support matching PSF stars in surveys against Gaia. Has been tested on publicly available DES and HSC data. Currently, the entire directory is designed with the DES example in mind. Each dataset might have its own quirks.

Directory structure required:

parent_dir/
    gaia_match_psf/
        contents of this repo

        results/
            gband/ -> these folders are not currently auto-generated, you have to add them
            iband/
            rband/
            ...

    int data/ -> intermediate data generated by the pipeline. 
        gdata/ -> these folders are not currently auto-generated, you have to add them
        idata/
        rdata/
        ...
    
    psf_data/
        input_dataset.csv/.h5 (specify how to read this file in src/*_des.py)
    
    

In results/, the final matched dataset will be placed within a directory that you specify. This is not a production-level code, so keep in mind that you will need to mess with specfic portions of the pipeline.
